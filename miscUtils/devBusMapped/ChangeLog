	20100412 (T.S.):

	* devBusMapped.h: Removed inclusion of dbAccess.h. This caused conflicts
	in applications which already would include cadef.h. EPICS apparently
	defines the same CPP symbols (DBF_xxx) in multiple headers :-(.
	Include link.h. instead.

	20100412 (T.S.):

	* devBusMapped.c: BUGFIX: parse constant link into pointer
	value rather than using recGblInitConstantLink() (which would
	yield truncated pointer on 64-bit platform).

	Use stdint types rather than guessing width of 'int', 'short int' etc;
	use 'uintptr_t' instead of unsigned long.

	20100412 (T.S.):

	* devAoBus.c: BUGFIX: removed extra ';' which resulted in an
	alarm being raised if 'pini=no'.

	20100412 (T.S.):

	* devAiBus.c, devAoBus.c, devBiBus.c, devBoBus.c, devLiBus.c, devLoBus.c,
	devMbbiBus.c, devMbboBus.c, devBusMapped.c, devBusMapped.h: 
	devBusMappedGetValue/devBusMappedPutValue (and low-level access methods)
	now pass epicsUInt32 instead of 'unsigned'.

	20100412 (T.S.):

	* ChangeLog: added.
